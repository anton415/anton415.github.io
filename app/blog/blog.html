          Sass for Web Designers by Dan Cederholm.

          Excellent book helps from setting up the environment to work with the basic functions of the language.
          For me, this book has become a great revelation that the process of writing styles can be optimized.
          Also a very useful description of the environment settings.
          I often have difficulty setting up the tool, so the author has helped me a lot.
          I was happy to apply some of the techniques from this book on my website.
          Maybe at the moment there have been no major changes in the process of my development,
          but I am sure that after a while, learning sass will help me a lot.
          I also plan to return to this book in order to use this or that technique.
          Many thanks to the author for an excellent book.
          I recommend reading this.
